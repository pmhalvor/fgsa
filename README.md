# FgFlex: A flexible multitasking sequence-labeler for fine-grained sentiment analysis

This repository contains the code developed for an experiment researching fine-grained sentiment analysis models for Norwegian text. 
Using the IMN [(He et al. 2019)](https://github.com/ruidan/IMN-E2E-ABSA) and RACL [(Chen et al. 2020)](https://github.com/NLPWM-WHU/RACL)


# Requirements
For reproducibility purposes, we outline the system requirements along with package dependencies needed to run this code.

## System requirements
Our Python runtime is 3.7.4.
Both Windows 10 and Linux Red Hat 8.5 operating systems were used under development and testing, ensuring cross-platform functionality.

### GPU
For faster training times, we recommend the use of a GPU node (especially for the larger models). 
Specifically, we made use of `cuda`-enabled
