# Slurm files

This directory contains the files used to queue Slurm-jobs.
Slight alterations are made for each architecture for cleaner job tracking through the Slurm system. 

For users who will test this code on the [Fox server](https://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/platforms/edu-research/help/hpc/docs/fox/), the actual modules used in our project can be found in these files.
